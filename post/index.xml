      <description>Five years ago I relaunched my blog on WordPress. As a Drupal developer I wanted to experience a competing product from the perspective of a regular user. A year later I become the development lead for Drupal Commerce, and my blogging mostly moved to the Drupal Commerce blog, with 15 posts over the past few years. Meanwhile, the desire to try other systems persisted. Our documentation site is powered by Grav nowadays, which had a good skeleton for what we needed to build.</description>

      <description>Web applications often need a way to represent and store hierarchies.
A menu with its submenus. A category with its subcategories. A comment and its replies. Storing the hierarchy, and later reconstructing it from the stored data is just a part of the puzzle. We also need a way to find the parents or children of an item. We need to be able to re-parent an item (move it to another part of the hierarchy).</description>
